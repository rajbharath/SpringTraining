Spring Training:
===============
This is the placeholder for my training on spring framework version 4

As a beginning I have started integrating spring with hibernate along with the postgresql db.

I have completed the below functionality
1. connected postgres db via hibernate using Spring framework's dependency Injection
2. inserted a row in "user" table
3. retrieved a user from the table

Note:
======
I have used the xml based spring configuration. In next commit I am going to do the same with annotation based bean configuration.
